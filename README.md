MARS (Massive Agent-Based Real-World Simulation) is an engine for building high-fidelity, data-driven digital twins of complex social systems.

This project provides a complete data processing pipeline to ingest raw social media data (e.g., from platforms like Weibo) and transform it into a runnable, large-scale agent-based model compatible with the OASIS multi-agent simulation platform. 

We are developing multiple downstream applications. Stay Tuned!
